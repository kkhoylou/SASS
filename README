KOTUS - Coming Together
By SASS

Notes to team:

To get the code for the first time run:
'git clone git@git.ucsd.edu:nlg/sass.git' in the folder you would like the repo folder to be downloaded
After that you will not need to run get clone ever again..
You will now need to untrack your userprefs so in the root of the repo type:
'git update-index --assume-unchanged KOTUS/KOTUS.userprefs'


To get the latest code, in the root of the repo type:
'git pull'

To update the repo first do a pull, then add your modified files using:
'git add file1.cs' to add a specific file or 'git add *.*' to add all modified files
then run 'git commit -m "INSERT A SUMMARY OF CHANGES"'
then run 'git push -u origin master'

if there is a collision it will let you know
